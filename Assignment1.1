2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
-> When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be 
the same length, R automatically recycles, or repeats, elements of the shorter one,
until it is long enough to match the longer Vector. 

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
for eg :
a->c(1,2,3,4)
b->c(5,6)
d->a+b
output:
6,8,8,10
